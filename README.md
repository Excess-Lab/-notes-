<p>
A local-first notes app for macOS: plain Markdown in a folder you own,<br>
automatic version history, on-device dictation and tasks that live in your calendar.

## Principles

> **Files are the source of truth.** Every note is an ordinary `.md` file. Open the folder in any
> editor, today or in ten years.
>
> **Local-first.** No accounts, no servers of ours. The network is touched only for your own GitHub
> and one-time model downloads.
>
> **Small by default.** The app ships light. Speech models are downloaded on demand, only the ones
> you turn on.

## Features

### ✎ Notes
Markdown in a regular folder, with tabs, folders, drag and drop, pinning and templates.
A daily note opens on launch. ⌘Z undoes everything, from a typo to a note sent to Trash.

### ⟲ Version history
The vault is a git repository. Edits are committed automatically, so any note can be rolled back.
Sign in to GitHub with a short device code (no password) and the history goes to your private repo.
Two Macs on one vault? Changes merge, and on a conflict both versions are kept.

### ⌕ One search
⌘K finds notes, tasks, calendar events, videos and words spoken in transcripts, all in one list.

### ◉ Dictation, anywhere in macOS
Hold a hotkey, talk, release. The text is on your clipboard or typed into the focused field.
Recognition runs on your Mac: **GigaAM** for Russian with punctuation, **Whisper** for 99 languages.
A glass orb listens with you and reacts to your voice.

### ☐ Tasks that reach your calendar
Write `- [ ] call Anna 📅 2026-11-03 15:00` in any note and it becomes a task in Apple Calendar.
Day, week and month views: drag to create, move and resize.

### ▶ Video and audio transcripts
Drop a recording to transcribe it on-device, with speakers you can rename.
Save it as a note or export to `.srt`.

### ✦ Apple Intelligence <sub>optional</sub>
One-tap note summaries and tasks pulled out of a transcript, computed on-device.

### ⚿ Privacy
PIN code and Touch ID. Tokens and the PIN live in the Keychain, never in files.

<sub>Light and dark themes · English, Russian, Serbian (Latin)</sub>

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS 27+ | ✅ Available, [download](https://github.com/Excess-Lab/-notes-/releases/latest) |
| Windows | 🚧 In progress. Same vault format: one folder works on both |

## Install

1. Download **`notes.dmg`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/Excess-Lab/-notes-/releases/latest).
2. Open it and drag **`<notes>`** into **Applications**.
3. This build is not notarized yet, so macOS asks once. Open
   **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway**.

## How your vault looks

```text
my-notes/                    any folder, also a git repo
├── Входящие.md              inbox for quick tasks
├── projects/
│   └── launch.md            - [ ] ship 1.0 📅 2026-11-01 15:00
├── шаблоны/                 templates: {{дата}} {{время}} {{название}}
│   └── день.md
└── расшифровки/             transcripts saved as notes
```

Nothing else goes into this folder. The search index, caches and models live in
`~/Library/Application Support` and are rebuilt from your files at any time.

## Build from source

**Requirements:** macOS 27+ and the latest Xcode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Excess-Lab/-notes-.git notes && cd notes
./Scripts/fetch-sherpa-onnx.sh   # speech runtime, ~100 MB, checksums verified
open "<notes>.xcodeproj"         # scheme <notes> → My Mac → ⌘R
```

```bash
cd NotesCore && swift test       # core tests
Scripts/make-dmg.sh              # installer → build/notes.dmg
```
